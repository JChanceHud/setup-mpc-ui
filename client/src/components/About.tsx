    After your participation you will be presented with a contribution
    hash. Please copy and paste it to a document you save on your computer.
    You will be able to use it to verify that your contribution was
    used by the next participant once we upload the complete contribution 
    transcript to our <StyledLink href='https://zkopru.network' target='_blank'>website</StyledLink>.

    <H3Title>How exactly does the setup work?</H3Title>
    <NormalBodyText>
    Our trusted setup is done in 2 steps. The first step 
    is already done and is called Perpetual Powers of Tau. 
    Itâ€™s an ongoing effort led by Wei Jie of the Ethereum 
    Foundation and the basis for many other ceremonies 
    such as tornado.cash and Hermez. The second step is 
    called Phase 2 and is circuit-specific, so it is 
    done separately for each different SNARK circuit. Our 
    phase 2 is based on the [!insertNumber!]th 
    contribution [!insertLink!] to Perpetual Powers of Tau ceremony.

    <H3Title>Why a trusted setup?</H3Title>
    <NormalBodyText>
      Zkopru relies on a number of different zk-SNARKs
      and each requires a trusted setup which ensures that
      no one is able to fake proofs and steal user funds or
      compromise privacy. The setup is performed in such a way
      that, to fake a proof, an attacker must compromise every
      single participant of the ceremony. Therefore, the security
      goes up with the number of participants.
