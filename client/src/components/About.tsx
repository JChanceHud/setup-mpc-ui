          Welcome to the trusted setup ceremony. This page will show the ceremonies that have been set up to collect contributions 
          as well as allowing you to contribute to these ceremonies.

        <Typography variant='h6'>What's a trusted setup?</Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>Zero-knowledge proofs are utilised in some decentralized applications as they provide security guarantees required by
        the application. A Trusted Setup is a part of the preparation for some zero-knowledge proofs. A ceremony consists of collection successive 
        contributions from a number of participants. Each participant performs a computation that combines some unique secret data with the ceremony data and the previous
        contributions. 
        <p /> 
        Now, a trusted setup computation, if it were done by the application developers, would function perfectly well, but it would open 
        up the possibility of interference with the proofs, which would reduce the security of the application. So, trusted setups are performed 
        by community contributors such as you. It only takes one contributor to provide a truly private contribution for the proof to 
        be secure against interference. 
        <p />
        Your contribution will help ensure the security of the application.  
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='h6'>How to contribute</Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>Your initial view will be a list of ceremonies, each with some brief summary details. Click on the 'PARTICIPATE' tab if you wish to 
        contribute your computation. Here you will see a 'LAUNCH' button. Click this when you are ready to start. All subsequent steps will automatically run 
        without further interaction.
        <p />
        Once the 'LAUNCH' button is clicked, a ceremony will be found for you to contribute to. If other participants are already waiting to contribute to the ceremony, you 
        will join the queue. Once your turn arrives, the computation will begin. The computation takes place in three stages: download, compute, and upload. Once these are
        complete, another ceremony will be sought, and, if found, the process will repeat.
